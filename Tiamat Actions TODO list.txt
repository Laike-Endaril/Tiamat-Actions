EXAMPLES

Sword Combo
on enqueue:
* if current action is Sword Attack 2, queue Sword Attack 3
* else if current action is Sword Attack 1, queue Sword Attack 2
* else queue Sword Attack 1



Sword attack
* keyframe / delay
* entity selector: cone (saves ordered entity list) -> "Targets" var (need to support Object variable holders in a hashmap, which are retained until action end) (need to have options for applying)
*
