Node types that need icons:
Get entity dimension
Get entity position
Set entity position
Queue action (different from "run sub-action")
Get entity look vector
Set entity look vector
Output Vector (ie. like string node, but for vectors)
Vector sum
Vector difference
Ray



Think it crashes if more than one input is added to test condition node; test and fix



New node types...

entity -> get position vector -> vector
entity, vector -> set position vector

entity -> get look vector -> vector
entity, vector -> set look vector

targetEntity, trueSourceEntity, damageTypeString, damageAmountString -> damage entity
targetEntity, trueSourceEntity, sourceEntity, damageTypeString, damageAmountString -> damage entity
