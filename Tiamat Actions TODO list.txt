Think it crashes if more than one input is added to test condition node; test and fix



New node types...

entity -> get position vector -> vector
entity, vector -> set position vector

entity -> get look vector -> vector
entity, vector -> set look vector

targetEntity, trueSourceEntity, damageTypeString, damageAmountString -> damage entity
targetEntity, trueSourceEntity, sourceEntity, damageTypeString, damageAmountString -> damage entity
